## Introduction
Polygon Race is a simple-to-play 3D racing video game developed in the Unity video game engine integrating other tools such as Blender and Adobe Illustrator , with a programming logic developed in the C# language. This game has a retro-futuristic aesthetic, in which the player is immersed in a busy highway that leads to the utopian city of Polygon City, whose objective is to move at high speed avoiding traffic, generating the highest possible score and thus becoming the best Polygon Racer.

## Contributing  

### For non-devs
If you want to contribute to our project, download it, play with it, and let us know what errors it has, and how we could improve the gameplay and add more mechanics to make it more fun, we will be more than willing to listen to your contributions.

### For devs
you have access to all the game files you can try to modify them add mechanics and whatever you want and we will be willing to review it and include it in the game if we like it,have fun experiencing how we have fun developing.

## Unity Teams
this project was carried out in Unity Teams for greater ease of group members we uploaded to github the condensed project that we had in unity for the access of the whole community


## Related projects
This project was inspired by the following video games

### Subway Surfers
Subway Surfers is an endless runner video game. The game starts by tapping the touch screen, while Jake (the game's starter character) or any other character sprays graffiti on a train, and then gets caught in the act by the inspector and his dog, who starts chasing the character. While running, the player can swipe up, down, left, or right to avoid crashing into oncoming obstacles, especially moving trains, poles, tunnel walls and barriers. By swiping rapidly as speed increases, more points can be acquired. A crash results in a game over.

### Traffic Racer
Traffic Racer is a 3D racing game available for Android, iOS, and Windows Mobile distributed in 2012 by Soner Kara.
It belongs to the type of video games in which infinite races are carried out with a cumulative score as the car advances, the end of the game being when the player collides with another vehicle in traffic. Its playability is through touch controls arranged on the screen of the device, which can be customized in distribution, size, and automatic accelerator option.

### Sayonara Wild  Hearts
Sayonara Wild Hearts is a rhythm game broken into 23 levels. In each level, the player controls the main character as they automatically travel through a surrealistic landscape alongside a pop music soundtrack. The general mechanics of each level change, but in general the player attempts to guide the character to collect hearts across the level to earn points, while avoiding obstacles.

## Technologies

### Blender
Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality, and computer games.

### Unity
Unity is a cross-platform game engine. The engine can be used to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming, such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering, and construction.

### C#
C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines.

## The Challenge
During the last years, the video game industry has experienced high growth rates, due to the development of computing, processing capacity, and audiovisual capacity. In terms of volume, there are around 383,000 games on Google Play, which means 15.34% of the applications on this platform, and they are the applications that are downloaded the most. During 2018, 38.68% of the estimated 29.4 billion downloads were games. 

According to the market intelligence company Newzoo, the video game industry closed 2019 with global revenues of more than 150,000 million dollars and year-on-year growth of 9.6%, dominating audiovisual entertainment, well ahead of music and cinema.
These data reveal a great need for people to occupy their leisure time through these types of applications. That is why this project proposes the development of a racing video game, with simple playability.

## What Is Next
We want to be able to scale this game in the future, This is a list of goals we want to achieve 

  1. Design and implement new levels  
  1. Design, model and implement a variety of different cars for gameplay   
  1. Implement more mechanics to give more diversity to the gameplay
  1. Create a small database in the cloud to see the scores of our friends and generate a field of competition
  1. Publish the game in the main mobile and computer stores, apple store, Play Store, Steam
