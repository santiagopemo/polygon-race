### Blender
Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality, and computer games.

### Unity
Unity is a cross-platform game engine. The engine can be used to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming, such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering, and construction.

### C#
C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines.

## The Challenge
During the last years, the video game industry has experienced high growth rates, due to the development of computing, processing capacity, and audiovisual capacity. In terms of volume, there are around 383,000 games on Google Play, which means 15.34% of the applications on this platform, and they are the applications that are downloaded the most. During 2018, 38.68% of the estimated 29.4 billion downloads were games. 

According to the market intelligence company Newzoo, the video game industry closed 2019 with global revenues of more than 150,000 million dollars and year-on-year growth of 9.6%, dominating audiovisual entertainment, well ahead of music and cinema.
These data reveal a great need for people to occupy their leisure time through these types of applications. That is why this project proposes the development of a racing video game, with simple playability.
