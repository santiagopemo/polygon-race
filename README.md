## Introduction
Polygon Race is a simple-to-play 3D racing video game developed in the Unity video game engine integrating other tools such as Blender and Adobe Illustrator , with a programming logic developed in the C# language. This game has a retro-futuristic aesthetic, in which the player is immersed in a busy highway that leads to the utopian city of Polygon City, whose objective is to move at high speed avoiding traffic, generating the highest possible score and thus becoming the best Polygon Racer.

This project was inspired by the following video games

### Subway Surfers
Subway Surfers is an endless runner video game. The game starts by tapping the touch screen, while Jake (the game's starter character) or any other character sprays graffiti on a train, and then gets caught in the act by the inspector and his dog, who starts chasing the character. While running, the player can swipe up, down, left, or right to avoid crashing into oncoming obstacles, especially moving trains, poles, tunnel walls and barriers. By swiping rapidly as speed increases, more points can be acquired. A crash results in a game over.
